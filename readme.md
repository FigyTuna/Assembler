Assembler for HACK machine code.


I made this based on a project from a book called "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan.
It's not very useful because assembly language is rarely ever written by humans anyway.
I will probably never make any changes to this and it'll be here to look pretty (despite how messy and quickly made it is).
I made it as a learning experience, and to make machine code for the Little Big Planet CPU I made.
